# NextJS Boilerplate

A simple NextJS boilerplate with pre-installed Redux and Axios. It's a work in progress and will be improved in the future, while the aim will be to keep it simple.

## Features

- Next.js: A React.js framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- Redux Toolkit: A set of tools that significantly reduces the amount of code needed to use Redux.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salnika/nextjs-boilerplate.git
```

Then, navigate into the directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd next-boilerplate
yarn install
```

Start the development server:

```
yarn run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying src/pages/index.ts. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
